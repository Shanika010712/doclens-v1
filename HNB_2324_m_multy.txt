Iterate through all rows and columns in every image to extract details for all accounts without skipping any.
For each account, extract the following:
Account Number: Listed under "Account No" or similar.
Currency Type: Listed under "Currency." If missing, default to "LKR."
Monthly Data: Extract the Gross Interest Paid, Withholding Tax (WHT) Deducted, and the name of the month:
Use the date provided in the field "Interest/Discount paid for Period".
Identify the correct month based on the start date of the range (e.g., 01-04-2023 to 30-04-2023 corresponds to April).
Ensure the month name matches the start date exactly.
Additional Details to Extract:

Bank Information: Name of the bank.
Account Holder Information: Name of the account holder or client and National Identity Card Number (NIC No.).
Statement Date: The date the statement was issued.
Output Format: For the overall details: [Name of the bank | Name of the account holder | National Identity Card No. | Date the statement was issued | WHT Agent TIN | WHT Certification No.]

For each account: [Account Number | Currency Type]

For each month's data: [Month | Gross Interest Paid | Withholding Tax (WHT) Deducted]

If any accounts are missing monthly data, add entries with the month name and zeros, e.g., (Month|0|0).

01-04-2023 to 30-04-2023 → April
01-05-2023 to 31-05-2023 → May
If a month is missing data for an account, add "Month|0|0" for that month in the output.
