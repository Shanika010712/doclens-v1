These are images of bank confirmation for a tax year which starts from 2024 April 1 and ends 2025 March 31.You will find bank accounts with interest and tax per month.
Read the images and identify the name of the bank, name of the account holder or client, National Identity card No.(NIC No.), Date that the statement was issued.
Look for keywords like "Account Number", "Currency", "Gross Interest", "Withholding Tax", "Balance" or similar variations. Extract data associated with these fields for each available month.

The month interest and tax data belongs to; i.e. the period interest paid for return only the name of the month
Account Number (A/C No)
Gross Interest paid ("Return value not found" if not found) i.e. interest paid from the account for the year
Withholding Tax (WHT) deducted ("Return value not found" if not found) i.e. tax amount deducted for the interest earned
Currency Type ("LKR" if not found) currency of the account
Account number & National Identity card No.(NIC No.) are totally different
repeat this for every Account number you found.
please include Gross Interest paid, Withholding Tax (WHT) deducted per every month data available. I have given you the example format for one bank account with two months but you may find more.
format the output for each month and account and the overall details as follows and separated by pipes ("|"). Ensure each monthly entry has 4 items as specified.
[name of the bank | name of the account holder or client | National Identity card No.(NIC No.) | Date that the statement was issued | WHT agent TIN | WHT certification no. (overall, if available)],[Account number|Currency Type],[Month| Gross Interest paid | Withholding Tax (WHT) deducted | WHT Certification Number for this Month],[Month| Gross Interest paid | Withholding Tax (WHT) deducted | WHT Certification Number for this Month]
if your output have same  (Account number|Currency Type) multiple times, merge those all as one 
Strictly follow the format given. If you can not find a value to a given field include a “0” or "Not Found" in the response instead. Do not add anything additional. The bank name should be mentioned only once, in the initial overall details section. Crucially, ensure that the value for 'Withholding Tax (WHT) deducted' in each monthly entry contains *only* the tax amount (or 'Return value not found') and *explicitly excludes* the bank name. Do not repeat the bank name elsewhere, and do not add any details not specifically requested. For 'WHT Certification Number for this Month', provide the certificate number if available for that specific month, otherwise use "Not Found" or "0".
