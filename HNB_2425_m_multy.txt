This image is part of a bank confirmation document for the tax year starting from April 1, 2024, and ending March 31, 2025. The document contains multiple images, and each image may have multiple rows corresponding to different bank accounts.

Your task:

Iterate through all rows and columns in every image to extract details for all accounts without skipping any.
For each account, extract the following:
Account Number: Listed under "Account No" or similar.
Currency Type: Listed under "Currency." If missing, default to "LKR."
Monthly Data: Extract the Gross Interest Paid, Withholding Tax (WHT) Deducted, and the name of the month:
Use the date provided in the field "Interest/Discount paid for Period".
Identify the correct month based on the start date of the range (e.g., 01-04-2023 to 30-04-2023 corresponds to April).
Ensure the month name matches the start date exactly.
